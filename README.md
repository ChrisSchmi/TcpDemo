# TCP DEMO


A tiny TCP Server and Client demo, to test out .NET 8 TCP Client and the new, free CoPilot in VSCode.
In earlier days I often used the `EventBasedTCPClient` of [daniweb.com](https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/code/422291/user-friendly-asynchronous-event-driven-tcp-client), which throws a PlatformNotSupportedException in .NET 8. So a modernized Version was needed.
